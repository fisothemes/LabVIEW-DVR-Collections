# LabVIEW DVR Collections

This repository contains VIs for handling DVR versions of LabVIEW maps, sets, variant attributes, and arrays. It takes advantage of VIMs to allow you to work with them as if they were generics as well as enhanced behaviours such as separation of the add and update operations and clearer labeling of connectors.
